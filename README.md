MPL Standard Library

This library contains generic algorithms and data structures for MPL SL.

Control:
  - Stack manipulators
  - Control flow manipulators
  - Function combinators

Containers:
  - Array container with constant access by index
  - LinkedList container with sequenced access to elements
  - HashTable associative container with unordered keys
  - BitSet container for efficient binary strings representations
  - RedBlackTree associative container with ordered keys

Utility classes:
  - Iterator as a pointer to container's element
  - Range as a useful abstraction to address several consecutive elements

Algebra:
  - Vector that represents row vectors from linear algebra
  - Matrix that represents matrices from linear algebra
  - various methods for matrices
